Greenhouse gas emissions can lead to global warming and climate change. From year to year, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. One of the main contributors is the electric power system that emits greenhouse gases. Power companies need an estimate of energy demand over the next ten to twenty years to make long-term planning. The methods used to build prediction models are LSTM and seasonal ARIMA. Transmission Service Operator (TSO) has made forecasting energy demand with MAPE of 1.09%. The MAPE value resulting from the LSTM model is 1.22%, while in the ARIMA model it is 23.33%. Based on RMSE, MAE, and MAPE error values, the LSTM model is better than the ARIMA model. The LSTM model also has accuracy that is close to the results of TSO forecasting. In addition, despite the insignificant overfitting, the LSTM model built is quite feasible.
